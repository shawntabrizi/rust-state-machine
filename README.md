# The Balances Pallet

In this section, we will build the very first logic for our state machine: a Balances Pallet.

This Pallet will manage the balances of users and allow them to transfer tokens to one another.

Along the way, you will learn about safe math, options, error handling, and more.

By the end of this section, you will have designed the logic of a simple cryptocurrency.
