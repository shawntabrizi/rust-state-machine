# Generic and Configurable Types

In this section, we will be harnessing the full power of Rust to create a generic and configurable Runtime.

There will be no real logical changes happening in the next steps.

Instead, we will be gradually abstracting away the concrete types defined in our Pallets, and instead structure our code to handle purely generic types.

At the end of the section, you will have a project whose structure exactly mirrors what is found in the Polkadot SDK and understand how all of it works.
