# Rust Macros

In this section, we will introduce Rust Macros to our project to reduce boilerplate code and automate implementations.

You can imagine that continuing to add new Pallets to our runtime would lead to a lot of similar or redundant code.

By the end of this section, you will see how Rust Macros can automatically generate the code we have been writing, and why the Polkadot SDK uses this technique to improve developer experience and output.
