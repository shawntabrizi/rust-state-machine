# The Proof of Existence Pallet

In this section, we will create a Proof of Existence Pallet.

We will take advantage of all the refactoring we have done so far to make it very simple to integrate this new Pallet into our existing Runtime.

There are no new concepts to learn in this section, however it will test that you understand and can reproduce all the steps and concepts learned in the previous sections.
